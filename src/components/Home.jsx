                                Hello, My name is Jeffery Pastva and I'm a Full Stack Developer. 
                                I bring strong leadership skills with articulate communication and multi-tasking to the table.
                                I enjoy problem solving and paying attention to detail.

                                Currently in the IT field, I support a wide range of issues and would like to bring the troubleshooting
                                and problem solving skills into my love for code. I wanted a change so I took the Full Stack Development 
                                bootcamp at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill where I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as frameworks and databases
                                I love learning and I'm going to continue educating myself in the world of software engineering. 
                                You can find some of my projects by clicking the "My Projects" tab!
